Here's what I had to do to get this homework assignment to build on Fedora 18:

All the steps, based on http://www.r-tutor.com/gpu-computing/cuda-installation/cuda5.5-fc18:

1. Uninstall the Nvidia drivers that I had installed from the RPMFusion repository.
2. Install the Nvidia drivers from the CUDA repository. The installer will fail to build the Nvidia Kernel modules because Fedora 18 currently runs kernel 3.10. Therefore, I had to apply this patch: http://pastebin.com/N0a5KMZa then manually execute the rest of the install scripts inside the RPM package.
3. Install CUDA per the tutorial in the link.
4. I couldn't get GLFW to work, so I used the Windows version as a starting point instead of the Mac Version :-P
5. I customized the Mac version's makefile to get it to compile.
6. I couldn't get Git to authenticate over HTTPS for some bizarre reason. I did it through SSH, by generating keys first: https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys
